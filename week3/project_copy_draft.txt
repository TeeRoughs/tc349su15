	About the artist
	>"My name is Tom Ruffley; I am a Michigan-based artist who has been drawing for most of my life.  The focus is on digital drawing/painting with a small amount of design on the side. I made the transition from paper to pixel a few years ago and I have not looked back since.  
	
	>"I am working more and more on my landscapes and abstract work, but you will always find me working on portraiture; drawing people from life and imagination is still my favorite."
	
	>"On this site you will find a collection of my personal projects along with a few professional ones (whenever possible). Enjoy!"
