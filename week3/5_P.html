	<h1>5 design principles and some examples</h1>
	<br></br>
	
	<h3>Affordance</h3>
	<h5>Website: http://lizz.es/</h5>
	<img src="\affordance.png"></img>
	<p>This website includes signposts as the point of navigation; it is an excellent example of affordance because the user would intuitively click on one of the signs to move between pages/content.  The association is made instantly.</p>
	
	<h3>Rule of thirds</h3>
	<h5>Website: http://www.studioairport.nl/</h5>
	<img src="\rule_of_thirds.png"></img>
	<p>In this example of the Rule of Thirds, the designers have their work organized into three distinct vertical columns that do not change, regardless of user location within this page.</p>
	
	<h3>Hick's Law</h3>
	<h5>Website: http://www.newegg.com</h5>
	<img src="\hicks_law.png"></img>
	<p>Retailer websites can be a prominent example of good choice management as well as a bad one.  Newegg.com is easily a case for good implementation of Hick's law because of the simplification of categories.  Starting from a few initial options the user can quickly branch out to more specific categories when desired; this helps to reduce navigation times and streamlines the shopping experience.</p>

	<h3>Signal-to-Noise Ratio</h3>
	<h5>Website: http://emilolsson.com/</h5>
	<img src="\signal_to_noise.png"></img>
	<p>This designer website really seems to aim for a simple layout and delivery of information.  The site is black and white with no complex background (or even sidebars).  The only information displayed are a few links at the top of the page followed by scrolling images of the portfolio.  This helps keep user attention focused on the work while minimizing distractions from other content on the site.</p>

	<h3>Golden Ratio</h3>
	<h5>Website: http://castirondesign.com/</h5>
	<img src="\golden_ratio.png"></img>
	<p>This designer site is a really cool example of the Golden Ratio in action. The images are all tiled on top of each other as the user scrolls up or down.  From my measurements, when comparing the height of a full image to the surrounding images/content, the ratio is approximately 1.618.</p>
